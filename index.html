            systemInstruction: `
            Generate a very very long (normaly it will be REALLY long - sometimes even up to 100s of instructions) series of clear, concise instructions to modify or create an index.html page that is already created - you cannot link css or js files, all in script or style tags - for the website the user specifies, or the user may put in a fictional webiste url, and you will generate what a functional website lcalled that would have. 
            Each instruction should be in plain English and separated by ¶ (dont use comments in instructions). The instructions should guide step-by-step actions,  including where in page to add elements, like main elements would be in the body, or all scripts beign in the same script tag etc. - obciously ensuring script and style tags are already created.
            From the start, the basic page structure will be there already, like html, head (with a title and style tag already), body (with a style tag already), etc. - but you will need to add all the elements, styles, and content to make it a fully functional website. Here is how the html starts:
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                    <title>Document</title>
                    <style></style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <header></header>
                    <div class="main-content"></div>
                    <script></` + `script>
                </b` + `ody>
                </html>
            Your first instruction should be to add a style tag in the head tag, and a script tag in the body tag.
            Emphasise that js should be in script tags, and css in style tags every time you need to add them - tell the ai to always "insert" in script/style tag the css..."
            such as adding HTML elements, applying CSS styles in style tags (you dont need to specify the css code, just what styles to apply), or adding content. 
            ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO ADD THE ELEMENTS IN THE BODY TAG, AND THE STYLES IN THE HEAD TAG
            Make sure to properly and very nicely style the entire page according to what the user wants (do not let anything look at all unproffessional), and as much js as needed for the functionality the user is looking for.
            Have in mind that css and js cannot be modified, only added to, so make sure to do full css classes in style tags, and js functions at a time, you may need to emphasise to do the whole function, linking to variables and functions not yet created, as there is a limit to how much can be done in 1 step.
            Also emphasise not to repeat code or definitions, and to make sure the code is as clean and efficient as possible.
            Also the ai executing the instructions will not know what to write as content for elements, so ask for example, span with a pretend name of a game website, or ask to make a p with an pretend description of a game, always for content tell it to generate pretend things etc. this is similiar with js or css styling - you can simply say add a hover effect that does x or a scroll effect that does y, or add nice modern colors and box shadow to this element etc. 
            For different types of websites you may need to add different types of elements, styles, and content, so make sure to adapt to the user's needs, for example if the user wants a website that doesnt need much js, focus on loads of styles including hover effects, click effects, and a clean page that fits the screen - like headers fitting by being position fixed, and aligned correctly and correct widths etc there is so much to do, but for a website that needs a lot of js, make sure to add all the js needed for the functionality, but make sure the page is still clean and professional.
            Do not stop at a basic website, add as much functionality as needed, like a button that does something, would not alert what the button does - it should actually work!
            Also for images, you can tell it to have an image with the src of https://quizizz-image-generation.blaub002-302.workers.dev/?prompt= + a description of the image, and it will generate an image for you.
            - but DO NOT simple have an image with src of screenshot of what it should look like - use images only for proper content.
            Example instructions: 
            "Add a few <div> elements with class 'container', style the .container elements using CSS style tags, 
            then add content inside the div elements like 'Welcome to my website', make the .button button have an onclick that it executes start() function."
            Make sure instructions are efficient, logically ordered, and avoid unnecessary repetition.
            Return all instructions in a single line, separated by ¶, without extra explanations or formatting.
            The finished result should have a high level of complexity as if made by a professional web developing company like google or microsoft.
            AFTERWARDS, ALWAYS FIX UP AND ADD STYLES TO THE PAGE TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE AND MORE AND MORE PROFESSIONAL LIKE SCROLLING EFFECTS HOVER EFFECTS ANIMATIONS ETC, AND MAKE SURE TO ADD ANY JS NEEDED FOR FUNCTIONALITY.
